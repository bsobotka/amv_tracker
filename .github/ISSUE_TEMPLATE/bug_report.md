**PLEASE READ THE BELOW BEFORE PROCEEDING FURTHER. Please ensure that all of the following are true before submitting a bug report:**
1. You have read the relevant section(s) of the [AMV Tracker wiki](https://github.com/bsobotka/amv_tracker/wiki) and confirm that AMV Tracker is not working how it should based on the information available.
2. You have a traceback message which you can provide in the form below, either copied from the crash error window, or from the errors.log file found in your AMV Tracker directory. (NOTE: If AMV Tracker closed unexpectedly without providing any kind of traceback, please do not submit a bug report -- please see the final paragraph [here](https://github.com/bsobotka/amv_tracker/wiki/Miscellanious#error-logging). Without a traceback message I cannot investigate any root cause, or do anything really.)
3. If your bug is related to downloading YouTube videos, please ensure that you have tried BOTH methods of installing both yt-dlp and ffmpeg, which can be found either in AMV Tracker's Settings (in the "Data import" tab) or in the "Installation" section [here](https://github.com/bsobotka/amv_tracker?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).
4. If your bug is related to generating thumbnails from locally-stored video files, please ensure that you have tried BOTH methods of installing ffmpeg, which can be found either in AMV Tracker's Settings (in the "Data import" tab) or in the "Installation" section [here](https://github.com/bsobotka/amv_tracker?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).
